      "atherton took over six years but the project is finally completed there is a full week end of celebrations to celebrate the grand opening here and i want to show you something take a look at these tables to your underneath these arches they're not just good looking they support the earthquake safe bridge and the arches run sedentem stories underground that's amazing if you think about it he delights will surrender each of the twenty arches along the bridge and its over a half a billion dollar project congressman in coshering on the state level your outer this morning this has to be a big deal and a sight to see for you as well as this is a major monasteries means over siddons it means that economic confusion of capital cash so this is really changing just that face of los angeles it's amazing to see its debut here and we'll see more of it over the weekend thanks so much district council member even dallies been working on this for years the largest bridge project in the city's history and it's no earthquake safeguarding will be looking at the international pedestrians dialetti they do so much as if you equatoria you won't see any bridge like this anywhere else reporting line new street bridge back to you in the studio \n"
